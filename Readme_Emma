Emma Laszlo, Readme File
For my custom class I represented my class as the real world object of a ball. 
class variables I implemented are temprature, gas constnat, and diameter. 
The data variables for my class are self, ball_type (the ball’s type), and pressure_p (the ball’s pressure). 
The two get-set methods include the pressure and type of the ball.
Two other methods implemented are inflate and deflate. 
My demo program takes the 3 different balls, basketball, soccer ball, and water polo ball
and infates and deflates them recieving the pressure of the each ball.
